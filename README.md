# Path-to-ML-DL
This repository is roughly based on the path followed by me in my DL/ML journey. It can serve as a rigorous guide for self taught beginners.
I have tried to include as many resources as I have used but this list is not exhaustive. For all books you can find them on [libgen.io](http://libgen.io) 
and for videos, you can mostly find them on YouTube.
